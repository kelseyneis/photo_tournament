# Photo Tournament Submission

The site is live [here](https://photo-tournament.herokuapp.com/)

Note: this is a partial solution to the requirements, all I managed to complete in the allotted time.

## Features

- User registration
- User login
- Retrieve list of image URLs on app startup
- Display first two

## Tournament implementation

Since I didn't manage to pull all of the pieces together in time, I've implemented the tournament piece as a python script, `tourney.py`, which uses `images_for_script.txt`. It can be run in the terminal with `python tourney.py`.
